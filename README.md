# 🚦 Road Accident Risk Predictor

## 📌 Overview

The **Road Accident Risk Predictor** is a machine learning project designed to predict the risk level of road accidents based on various factors such as weather conditions, traffic data, road characteristics, and driver-related features. The goal of this project is to support road safety analysis and help in taking preventive measures to reduce accidents.

## 📈 Results

* The model outputs a predicted **risk level** (e.g., Low / Medium / High)
* Performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Use real-time traffic and weather data
* Deploy as a web application
* Improve accuracy with advanced models (XGBoost, Neural Networks)
* Add explainability (SHAP, LIME)
